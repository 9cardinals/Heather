        <h1>Introducing SoundRad</h1>
        <p>I love SoundCloud – I’ve been a user since it was in beta in 2008. (I’m user #1561 according to their API.) SoundCloud’s really grown up since I started using it. It used to be just people I knew sharing early versions of tracks, and now the community is so big, I am constantly inundated with new musical discoveries. While the new SoundCloud design is a huge step forward, it’s still clear that the company is focused on the creator side of things. The navigation design is spectacular, but the site’s performance is infuriatingly slow.</p>

        <h1>Buckets & Jumpoffs: Using Content-Centric Contextual Navigation</h1>
        <p>While table views provide a clear and simple way to navigate certain types of content, mobile should be about putting content and user goals first and navigation second. Don’t overload the user with navigation choices, show meaningful content instead. Even though tab bars are great – sitting below the content, out of the way until the user needs them – there are new opportunities to explore content-centric contextual navigation when designing for mobile.</p>
