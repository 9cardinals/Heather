  <p>I love SoundCloud – I’ve been a user since it was in beta in 2008. (I’m user #1561 according to their API.) SoundCloud’s really grown up since I started using it. It used to be just people I knew sharing early versions of tracks, and now the community is so big, I am constantly inundated with new musical discoveries. While the new SoundCloud design is a huge step forward, it’s still clear that the company is focused on the creator side of things. The navigation design is spectacular, but the site’s performance is infuriatingly slow.</p>

  <p>While table views provide a clear and simple way to navigate certain types of content, mobile should be about putting content and user goals first and navigation second. Don’t overload the user with navigation choices, show meaningful content instead. Even though tab bars are great – sitting below the content, out of the way until the user needs them – there are new opportunities to explore content-centric contextual navigation when designing for mobile.</p>

  <p>Your tiny type is hard to read – no, not hard to read, impossible to read. I carry my phone with me everywhere, but I always seem to forget my magnifying glass. I tap the Safari Reader button, but that’s not a solution to the problem. That’s a band-aid for your bad typesetting.</p>

  <p>At first glance, these two navigation patterns seem very similar, but there are a few points that give table views* a huge leg up. When dealing with a multi-tiered hierarchy or a variable amount of navigation items – such as text messages, emails, folksonomic categories, folders, files, etc. – table views can be a great solution. Lists are generally easier to scan than tiles, and vertical scrolling is an easy interaction for touchscreen mobile devices.</p>

  <p>When opening an application, a user should be able to understand its functionality, see relevant content, and get to where they want to go. Applications that obscure navigation with the intent of focusing on content can make finding specific information difficult. On the other hand, skewing towards too much navigation can overwhelm the user. Mobile apps should balance navigation for users with different information needs.</p>
